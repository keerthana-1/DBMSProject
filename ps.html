<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>XYZ hospital is a multi specialty hospital that includes a number of departments, rooms,  doctors, nurses, compounders, and
 other staff working in the hospital. Patients having different kinds of ailments come to the hospital and get checkup done from the 
concerned doctors. If required they are admitted in the hospital and discharged after treatment. The aim of this case study is to design
 and develop a database for the hospital to maintain the  records of various departments, rooms, and doctors in the hospital. It also 
maintains records   the regular patients, patients admitted in the hospital, the check up of patients done by the  doctors, the patients 
that have been operated, and patients discharged from the hospital.  Description: In hospital, there are many departments like Orthopedic,
 Pathology, Emergency, Dental, Gynecology, Anesthetics, I.C.U., Blood Bank, Operation Theater, Laboratory, M.R.I., Neurology,
Cardiology, Cancer Department, Corpse, etc. There is an OPD where patients come and get a card (that is, entry card of the patient) 
for check up from the concerned doctor. After making entry in the card, they go to the concerned doctor’s room and the doctor checks
 up their ailments. According to the ailments, the doctor either prescribes medicine or admits the patient in the concerned department.
 The patient may choose either private or general roomaccording to his/her need. But before getting admission in the hospital, the patient
 has to fulfill certain formalities of the hospital like room charges, etc. After the treatment is completed, the doctor discharges the patient. 
Before discharging from the hospital, the patient again has to  complete  certain  formalities  of  the  hospital  like  balance  charges, 
 test  charges,  operationcharges (if any), blood charges, doctors’ charges, etc.  Next we talk about the doctors of the hospital. 
There are two types of the doctors in the hospital, namely, regular doctors and call on doctors. Regular doctors are those doctors 
who come to the hospital daily. Calls on doctors are those doctors who are called by the hospital if the concerned doctor is not available.
